The goal of this tool is to allow users to focus on problem specification. Notably, Eleanor is only designed to employ specific subsets of the eq36 family, and is not suitable for handling some EQ3/6 functionality.

    "text": "User Notes\nEleanor is designed to use specific (and limited) functionality within EQ3/6 to inform on a specific type of geochemical problem. We wanted to know, what are all of the fluid compositions that are consistent with very limited environmental signals, specific if we know that a given mineral or mineral/s is equilibrium with the fluid. Eleanor allows a user to consider uncertainty in unknown variables by setting them to ranges, instead of leaving them out or setting them to arbitrary values. We walk through an example use case in Example_0 provided with Eleanor where we explore the fluids the care derived from calcite and aragonite on the seafloor, when the water column sets ranges on total element abundances for example, instead of picking a specific values for a basis species. As such, a large number of user controls in EQ3/6 do not port though to Eleanor.\nA few notable limitation, for those familiar with EQ3/6:\n\nEleanor does not allow you to set basis species to homogeneous or heterogeneous equilibrium (except for \\(f_{O2}\\)).\nSpecial basis switching is enabled, but general basis switching is not.\nIon exchangers are not used.\nSpecial reactants are not allowed in EQ6, only minerals and gases for the time being.\nFluid mixing is not currently enabled.\nIn EQ6, Eleanor only populates the SQL database with the data from the last Xi step in the 6o file, the final step in the reaction path. Therefore the SQL databases associated with a given campaign contain the initial constraints (VS, or variable space table), the data retrieved from the 3o files (ES3, or Equilibrium Space 3o table), and the data retrieved form the last Xi step in the 6o files (ES6, or, Equilibrium Space 6o table)."

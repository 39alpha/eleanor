This allows the user to run small batches for initial testing and subsequent batches to more fully sample the variable space, an “extension run”.\nThe create_date value is the datetime at which the order was initially created. Subsequent extension runs do not update the create_date.\nExample:\nSELECT id, name, hash, eleanor_version, create_date FROM orders;\n\n+----+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+\n| id | name                 | hash                                                             | eleanor_version | create_date            |\n|----+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+------------------------|\n| 1  | A Wild Example Order | 9a511f8f977d86264a8329b8a75bc9d489237d6ad249ab009c73f8e159360c36 | 0.19.0          | 2026-01-09 10:59:01.98 |\n+----+----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+------------------------+\n\n\nhuffer\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n✔\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe huffer entry identifier corresponds to the order id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexit_code\nINTEGER\nThe exit code generated by the huffer (non-zero for failure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip\nBLOB\nA zip archive of the input files used and output files generated when running the huffer. This includes a traceback when an error occurs\n\n\n\n\nThe user may opt to run the huffer to check the validity of the order they have submitted before generating variable space data. The huffer chooses a single variable space point consistent with the order and fully speciates it. The exit code generated by the kernel (non-zero for failure) is stored along with a zip archive of the kernel input and output files and a traceback if an error occurred.\nThis table is primarily useful for debugging.\nExample:\nSELECT * FROM huffer;\n\n+----+-----------+----------+\n| id | exit_code | zip      |\n|----+-----------|----------|\n| 1  | 0         | &lt;binary&gt; |\n+----+-----------+----------+\n\n\nvariable_space\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe variable space point identifier\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\norder_id\nINTEGER\nThe order id for which the point was generated\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntemperature\nDOUBLE\nThe temperature\n\\(^\\circ C\\)\n\n\n\n\n\npressure\nDOUBLE\nThe pressure\n\\(bar\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nexit_code\nINTEGER\nThe exit code generated by the kernel (non-zero for failure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate_date\nDATETIME\nThe datetime when the variable space point was created\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart_date\nDATETIME\nThe datetime when the equilibration started\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomplete_date\nDATETIME\nThe datetime when the equilibration completed\n\n\n\n\nWhen the user runs Eleanor, a specified number of variable space points are selected based on the constraints provided by that order. Each point represents the unspeciated initial state of a system and includes such information as:\n\nTemperature\nPressure\nKernel Settings (kernel)\nElemental Composition (elements)\nSpecies Constraints (species)\nReactant Specifications, including:\n\nAqueous Reactants (aqueous_reactants)\nElement Reactants (element_reactants)\nFixed Gas Reactants (fixed_gas_reactants)\nGas Reactants (gas_reactants)\nMineral Reactants (mineral_reactants)\nSolid Solution Reactants (solid_solution_reactants)\nSpecial Reactants (special_reactants)\n\nSuppressions (suppressions)\n\nThe variable_space table stores the core information about the variable space point per row. This includes an autoincremented id, the temperature and pressure of the system, and the datetime at which it was generated. Each point refers back to the order to which it belongs via the order_id.\nAfter generating the variable space point, Eleanor proceeds to speciate the system using the user-specified kernel. The exit_code generated by the kernel as well as the datetimes of when the speciation started and completed are stored in the variable_space table as well.\nExample:\nSELECT * FROM variable_space ORDER BY id LIMIT 1;\n\n+----+----------+-------------+----------+-----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+\n| id | order_id | temperature | pressure | exit_code | create_date                | start_date                 | complete_date              |\n|----+----------+-------------+----------+-----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------|\n| 1  | 1        | 300.0       | 500.0    | 0         | 2026-01-09 10:59:02.541519 | 2026-01-09 10:59:02.546294 | 2026-01-09 10:59:02.843071 |\n+----+----------+-------------+----------+-----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+\n\nscratch\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n✔\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe scratch entry identifier corresponds to the variable space id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip\nBLOB\nA zip archive of the input files used and output files generated when equilibrating the variable space point. This includes a traceback when an error occurs\n\n\n\n\nThe input files used and output files generated by the kernel when speciating a “variable space” point are stored in a zip archive in the scratch table. The scratch row will have the same id as the associated variable space point.\nBy default, Eleanor only stores scratch entries if an error occurs while speciating the variable space point, as signified by a non-zero exit code from the kernel. In such a case a traceback.txt file is included in the zip archive detailing the error. The user may specify, at runtime, that scratch be collected for all variable space speciations. In that case, no traceback.txt file is included in the zip archive.\nExample:\nSELECT * FROM scratch WHERE variable_space_id = 1;\n\n+----+----------+\n| id | zip      |\n|----+----------|\n| 1  | &lt;binary&gt; |\n+----+----------+\n\n\nkernel\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n✔\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe kernel entry identifier corresponds to the variable space point\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nVARCHAR\nThe type of the kernel used, e.g. eq36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsettings\nJSON\nA JSON-encoded object of the settings passed to the kernel\n\n\n\n\nEleanor is designed to support user-provided kernels which may require specific configuration or settings. Those settings are stored in the kernel table, one row for each variable space point. The kernel settings row will have the same id as the variable space point to which it belongs. The type of the kernel is stored alongside a JSON encodedded settings object, the form of which is kernel-specific.\nWhile, at the moment, only the eleanor.kernel.eq36 kernel is provided out-of-the-box, future versions may include other kernel implentations or the user may design and implement their own. It is then difficult to design a schema for storing the settings. Using a JSON object makes things simpler given PostgreSQL’s native JSON support.\nExample:\nSELECT * FROM kernel WHERE id = 1;\n\n+----+------+------------------------------------------------------+\n| id | type | settings                                             |\n|----+------+------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1  | eq36 | {\"model\": 0, \"timeout\": null, \"basis_map\": {}, ... } |\n+----+------+------------------------------------------------------+\n\n\n\nelements\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe element identifier, specific to the variable space point\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\nvariable_space_id\nINTEGER\nThe id of the variable space point for which elemental molality was generated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nVARCHAR\nThe name of the element (atomic symbol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_molality\nDOUBLE\nThe log molality of the element in the variable space solution\n\\(\\log{molal}\\)\n\n\n\nThe elemental composition of the system’s fluid must be provided as part of the specification of a variable space point. Each element in the fluid is stored in the elements table with a unique, autoincremented id, the name of the element, and the log_molality that was chosen when the variable space was generated. Each element references the variable space point it is associated with by the variable_space_id.\nExample:\nSELECT *\n FROM elements\n WHERE variable_space_id = 1\n ORDER BY name;\n\n+----+-------------------+------+--------------+\n| id | variable_space_id | name | log_molality |\n|----+-------------------+------+--------------|\n| 1  | 1                 | C    | -9.0         |\n| 4  | 1                 | Ca   | -9.0         |\n| 5  | 1                 | Cl   | -9.0         |\n| 7  | 1                 | Fe   | -9.0         |\n| 6  | 1                 | Mg   | -9.0         |\n| 8  | 1                 | N    | -9.0         |\n| 2  | 1                 | Na   | -9.0         |\n| 3  | 1                 | Si   | -9.0         |\n+----+-------------------+------+--------------+\n\n\n\nspecies\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe species identifier, specific to the variable space point\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\nvariable_space_id\nINTEGER\nThe id of the variable space point for which the species molality/activity/fugacity was generated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nVARCHAR\nThe name of the species\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nDOUBLE\nThe log molality/activity/fugacity of the species in the variable space solution\nvariable\n\n\n\nConstraints on the aqueous and gaceous species in the system may, though in some cases must, be provided as part of the specification of a variable space point, such as the \\(pH\\) and \\(fO_2\\) of the system. Each species constraint is stored in the species table with a unique, autoincremented id, the name of the species, and the value of the constraint (log molality, log activity or log fugacity as appropriate) that was chosen when the variable space was generated. Each element references the variable space point it is associated with by the variable_space_id.\nExample:\nSELECT *\n FROM species\n WHERE variable_space_id = 1\n ORDER BY name;\n\n+----+-------------------+-------+-------+\n| id | variable_space_id | name  | value |\n|----+-------------------+-------+-------|\n| 1  | 1                 | H+    | -7.0  |\n| 2  | 1                 | O2(g) | -1.0  |\n+----+-------------------+-------+-------+\n\n\nReactants\nSeveral types of reactant can be specified in an order, facilitating the simulation of a wide variety of systems.

Each of these points, consisting of identifying information (id, variable_space_id, stage and log_xi) and a wide range of system properties (e.g. temperature, pressure, \"pH\", etc…), is stored as a row in the equilibrium_space table. Additional, information about the system, such as the quantity of reactants reacted and remaining (equilibrium_reactants), the elemental composition of the fluid (equilibrium_elements), the molecular composition of the flud (equilibrium_aqueous_species), etc…, are stored in auxiliary tables that link back to the equilibrium space point via a foreign key reference on their equilibrium_space_id column.\nFor example, the builtin eleanor.kernel.eq36.Kernel will produce at least \\(2\\) equilibrium space points: one representing the speciation of the fluid alone (the \"eq3\" stage), and the final equilibrium after reacting the fluid with any reactants (the \"eq6\" stage). In the case that the user configured the kernel with the track_paths: true option, (many) more than \\(2\\) equilibrium space points will be produced: the \"eq3\" point, and some number of intermediate points between the \"eq3\" system and the final \"eq6\" representing a titration path. That is, each point along the titration path represents the equilibration of the fluid with an increasing quantity of reactant. The progress along the path is tracked by \\(\\xi\\) (stored as log_xi). The log_xi value will be NULL for \"eq3\" stage points as \\(\\xi\\) is undefined.\nDifferent kernels, and different stages processed by a given kernel, may result in some columns being either NULL or -inf for one reason or another. This can cause confusion. Take for example the case of log_xi before. The \"eq3\" stage points will have log_xi = NULL, and the first point of a titration path produced in the \"eq6\" stage will have log_xi = -inf (\\(\\xi = 0\\) at the start of the path). However, if the user did not enable path tracking or set the kernel’s print settings judiciously, then the first \"eq6\" stage point may have a finite log_xi. Other examples include:\n\nSince mass is not transfered in the \"eq3\" stage, columns such as solid_mass_change will be NULL, and\nThough they represent the the same quantity, more or less, the \"eq3\" stage outputs sigma while \"eq6\" outputs total_charge and only one of the two will be non-NULL.\n\nFinally, each kernel may be implemented to compute and store non-standard properties, i.e. properties for which there is no equilibrium_space column or associated auxiliary table.

Fixed gas reactants are enforced by requiring equilibrium with a fictitious solid phase in equilibrium_pure_solids, e.g. CO2(g) as a fixed gas reactant will produce a pure solid of \"fix_fCO2(g)\", and do not appear in the equilibrium_reactants table.\n\nThe equilibrium_reactants table is most useful for two purposes:\n\nQuality assurance. At the end of the equilibration, all the log_moles_remaining ought to be -inf (no reactant). If that is not the case, then the reaction did not progress far enough and kernel settings likely need to be tweaked.\nPath Tracking. If titration path tracking is enabled, the log_moles_reacted should monotonically increase while log_moles_remaining monotonically decreases along the path (ordered by log_xi from the equilibrium_space table).\n\n\nExample:\nSELECT\n   id,\n   equilibrium_space_id AS eid,\n   name,\n   affinity,\n   relative_rate AS rate,\n   log_moles_reacted AS moles_reacted,\n   log_moles_remaining,\n   log_mass_reacted,\n   log_mass_remaining\n FROM equilibrium_reactants\n WHERE equilibrium_space_id = 2\n ORDER BY name;\n\n+----+-----+------------------+-----------+------+----------------------+---------------------+----------------------+--------------------+\n| id | eid | name             | affinity  | rate | moles_reacted        | log_moles_remaining | log_mass_reacted     | log_mass_remaining |\n|----+-----+------------------+-----------+------+----------------------+---------------------+----------------------+--------------------|\n| 5  | 2   | CaCl2            | 9999999.0 | 0.0  | -2.0                 | -inf                | 0.045283851395135605 | -inf               |\n| 3  | 2   | CalciumHydroxide | 9999999.0 | 0.0  | -2.0                 | -inf                | -0.13021109763031236 | -inf               |\n| 1  | 2   | hematite         | 1.43      | 1.0  | -0.29999760285774607 | -inf                | 1.903285375549671    | -inf               |\n| 6  | 2   | N2(g)            | 9999999.0 | 1.0  | -0.29999760285774607 | -inf                | 1.1473671077937864   | -inf               |\n| 2  | 2   | olivine-ss       | 1.7744    | 1.0  | -0.29999760285774607 | -inf                | 1.9517453891382763   | -inf               |\n| 4  | 2   | Si               | 9999999.0 | 0.0  | -2.0                 | -inf                | -0.5515101084889142  | -inf               |\n+----+-----+------------------+-----------+------+----------------------+---------------------+----------------------+--------------------+\n\n\nequilibrium_elements\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe equilibrium element identifier\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\nequilibrium_space_id\nINTEGER\nThe id of the equilibrium space point\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nVARCHAR\nThe name of the element (atomic symbol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_molality\nDOUBLE\nThe molality of the element in solution\n\\(\\log{molal}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nmass_fraction\nDOUBLE\nThe fraction of solution mass accounted for by ths element\nunitless\n\n\n\nEvery equilibrium_space entry will be associated with some number of rows in the equilibrium_elements table, one for each element in the fluid.

    "text": "Aqueous speciation modeling has historically focused on specific, well defined systems, and is ideal for laboratory settings or the study of a small number of real-world systems. Standard tools such as Geochemist’s Workbench and EQ3/6 exist to fill this niche, alongside more recent additions such as the WORM Portal. However, existing tools are not ideal for the study of systems that are underspecified (e.g. have incomplete composition), have high degrees of uncertainty (e.g. imprecise characterization), or for understanding the broader equilibrium landscape of systems of interest (e.g. serpentinizing systems in general). Eleanor is a powerful open-source modeling framework based on EQ3/6 which fills this gap, providing the process and data orchestration features necessary to facilitate large-scale aqueous speciation modeling. Eleanor includes a standalone executable which accepts a problem specification in YAML, TOML or JSON format, samples fully-defined systems for speciation via the EQ3/6-based “kernel”, validates the results, and stores the data in a Postgres. Eleanor’s modular design allows the user to swap the EQ3/6-based kernel with one of their own.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

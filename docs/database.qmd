# Overview

The primary function of **Eleanor** is to accept a problem detailing how
to select fully-specified aqueous speciation problems, referred to as an
["order"](#orders), equilibrate them, and curate the resulting data.

Each such selected problem corresponds to a point (row) in the "variable space"
([`variable_space`](#variable_space) table). Each order may then have any
number of associated variable space rows. The properties of the variable space
points are broken out over a number of tables, e.g. the [`elements`](#elements)
table contains the elemental composition of the fluid before speciation,
the [`mineral_reactants`](#mineral_reactants) table contains the amount and
titration rate of each mineral to be reacted with the system, etc...

Speciation is then handled by the kernel specified in the order,
which may produce zero or more points (rows) in the "equilibrium space"
([`equilibrium_space`](#equilibrium_space) table). Each row for a given
variable space point represents some form or degree of equilibration. For
example, the `eq36` kernel performs the equilibration in two stages, first
speciating the fluid alone (the `"eq3"` stage) and then equilibrating the
fluid with the reactants (the `"eq6"` stage). As such, any variable space
point equilibrated with the `eq36` kernel will have at least two equilibrium
points associated with it (more on this below). As with variable space
points, several tables contain detailed information about the equilibrium
space points, e.g. the [`equilibrium_elements`](#equilibrium_elements) table
contains the elemental composition of the fluid after the given speciation, the
[`equilibrium_reactants`](#equilibrium_reactants) table contains information
about how much of each reactant has been, and how much remains to be, reacted,
etc...

# Tables

This document describes each table in the schema and its relationship to
the other tables. For brevity we use a few abbreviations as follows:

|**Key** |             |
|-       |-            |
|PK      | Primary Key |
|FK      | Foreign Key |
|N       | Nullable    |

Every table a has single primary key (**PK**)---`id`---without exception, though
that my change in subsequent versions of **Eleanor** (but probably not).

As described in [Overview](#overview), the **Eleanor** database
is somewhat hierarchical with the [`orders`](#orders) table as the root, zero
or more entries in the [`variable_space`](#variable_space) table referring
to an entry in [`orders`](#orders), and with zero or more entries in the
[`equilibrium_space`](#equilibrium_space) table referring to an entry in the
[`variable_space`](#variable_space) table. These relationships are reflected in
two ways in this document:

1. The document headings are structured such that each table refers to the table
   one-level above it.
2. The foreign keys (**FK**) are noted in the tables, and the associated column
   name links to the referenced table. These column names are generally of the
   form `*_id`. The only exceptions to this form rule are for tables with a
   one-to-one, rather than many-to-one, relationship, e.g. there is at most one
   [`huffer`](#huffer) entry for each [`orders`](#orders), so the **FK** is
   simply `id`.

Most columns in the **Eleanor** database are `NOT NULL`, meaning they are
guaranteed to have a value, though that value may be some standard value
representing "absent" or "missing", e.g. `-Infinity`. Columns that are nullable
(**N**) are denoted as such.

# Eleanor

Eleanor is a package for large scale aqueous geochemical modelling. It is based
on the thermodynamic modelling software EQ3/6. Eleanor provides a means to
generate huge volumes of simulated thermodynamic data by defining a specific
type of problems that are automatically deployed to EQ3/6. The goal of this
tool is to allow users to focus on problem specification. Notably, Eleanor is
only designed to employ specific subsets of the eq36 family, and is not
suitable for handling some EQ3/6 functionality. The example problem that
deploys with Eleanor describes and exemplifies the type of geochemical problem
Eleanor was built to evaluate.

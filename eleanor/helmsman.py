    Keeping with the naval terminology: The Navigator charts where to go.
    Then the helmsman guides the ship there, using sailors to do the necessary work.

    Navigator decides the region of parameter space to be explored, by issuing orders that are
    written in the `vs` (variable space) table. Each order contains a collections of discrete
    `vs` points distributed about the parameter space. The dimension of the parameter space
    thermodynamic (temperature, pressure, total C, total Fe, `etc`.). Each point in this parameter
    space contains variables (dimensions) sufficient to describes a closed thermodynamic system.

    The goal of the helmsman is to solve for the equilibrium behavior of each of these points
    distributed about the variable space (`vs`).

    The Helmsman does this by spawning a small number of sailors (with number of sailors
    determined by system capabilities), assigning each a `vs` point that they will thermodynamic
    'solve' in succession until all points have been solved.

    Each vs point assigned to a sailor, contains enough information to define a closed
    thermodynamic system. The sailor employs EQ3/6 to determine the equilibrium
    characteristic of the system defined by the `vs` point, thus generating an associated point
    in the equilibrium space (`es`) table.

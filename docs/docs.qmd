## A warning
The goal of this code is to make running geochemical models at scale easier. Running those models
and getting an answer without an error does not mean you've set up a physically meaningful model.
This software is not a substitute for a principled understanding of the underlying chemistry.
While we hope other scientists can use this software to help answer questions about their system of
interest, we also recognize that there are likely more ways to use this software incorrectly than
correctly. We aim to protect against these cases but that attempt will always be incomplete.

All of this is to say - we hope this project helps you do science faster. But faster doesn't mean
correct.

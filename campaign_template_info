"guided EQ":{

	### when does the system stop, upon exhaustion of the reactant (ie, as in the CO2 reaction), or when the target reacting reaches EQ, as in the mienral reaction axamples.
	I wonder if we can react to soemthing short of affinity - 0 by test for affinity = -=1000, for example.

Modes:
	Manual: User knows exactly what they are doing, and wants to run their own 3i/6is as they have them set up. This turns our code into just a dumb eq36 executor. This allows users who know what they are doing to contune using the full functionality of EQ36, as our 'guided' problems use very specfiic (and limited) functionality within EQ36.

	Reaction EQ: Currently the only nav/helm funtionality. fluid system is reacted with a target reactant, which can be a special reactant, mineral or gas. If "stop" = "exhaustion" then morr is made very large, so as to never run out of reaction mass. This means that they system only stops with it comes to equilibrium with teh target mineral. Currently. This function only grabs the 6o data from the final eq step of the file. We do not grab reaction path data. By setting the mode to anything other than 'manual' the user must also populate the remaining data fields int he json file.

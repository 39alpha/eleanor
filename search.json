This allows the user to run small batches for initial testing and subsequent batches to more fully sample the variable space, an “extension run”.\nThe create_date value is the datetime at which the order was initially created. Subsequent extension runs do not update the create_date.\nExample:\nexample=# SELECT * FROM mineral_reactants WHERE variable_space_id = 1;\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n| id | variable_space_id | name       | log_moles | titration_rate |\n|----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------|\n| 1  | 1                 | fayalite   | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n| 2  | 1                 | forsterite | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n\nhuffer\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n✔\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe huffer entry identifier corresponds to the order id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexit_code\nINTEGER\nThe exit code generated by the huffer (non-zero for failure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip\nBLOB\nA zip archive of the input files used and output files generated when running the huffer. This includes a traceback when an error occurs\n\n\n\n\nThe user may opt to run the huffer to check the validity of the order they have submitted before generating variable space data. The huffer chooses a single variable space point consistent with the order and fully speciates it. The exit code generated by the kernel (non-zero for failure) is stored along with a zip archive of the kernel input and output files and a traceback if an error occurred.\nThis table is primarily useful for debugging.\nExample:\nexample=# SELECT * FROM mineral_reactants WHERE variable_space_id = 1;\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n| id | variable_space_id | name       | log_moles | titration_rate |\n|----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------|\n| 1  | 1                 | fayalite   | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n| 2  | 1                 | forsterite | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n\n\nvariable_space\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe variable space point identifier\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\norder_id\nINTEGER\nThe order id for which the point was generated\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntemperature\nDOUBLE\nThe temperature\n\\(^\\circ C\\)\n\n\n\n\n\npressure\nDOUBLE\nThe pressure\n\\(bar\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nexit_code\nINTEGER\nThe exit code generated by the kernel (non-zero for failure)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncreate_date\nDATETIME\nThe datetime when variable space was created\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstart_date\nDATETIME\nThe datetime when the equilibration started\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomplete_date\nDATETIME\nThe datetime when the equilibration completed\n\n\n\n\nWhen the user runs Eleanor on an order a specified number of variable space points are selected based on the constraints provided by that order. Each point represents the unspeciated initial state of a system and includes such information as.\n\nTemperature\nPressure\nKernel Settings (kernel)\nElemental Composition (elements)\nSpecies Constraints (species)\nReactant Specifications, including:\n\nAqueous Reactants (aqueous_reactants)\nElement Reactants (element_reactants)\nFixed Gas Reactants (fixed_gas_reactants)\nGas Reactants (gas_reactants)\nMineral Reactants (mineral_reactants)\nSolid Solution Reactants (solid_solution_reactants)\nSpecial Reactants (special_reactants)\n\nSuppressions (suppressions)\n\nThe variable_space table stores the core information about the variable space point per row. This includes an autoincremented id and the temperature and pressure of the system, and the datetime at which it was generated. Each point refers back to the order to which it belongs via the order_id.\nAfter generating the variable space point, Eleanor proceeds to speciate the system using the user-specified kernel. The exit_code generated by the kernel as well as the datetimes of when the speciation started and completed are stored alongside in the variable_space table as well.\nExample:\nexample=# SELECT * FROM mineral_reactants WHERE variable_space_id = 1;\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n| id | variable_space_id | name       | log_moles | titration_rate |\n|----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------|\n| 1  | 1                 | fayalite   | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n| 2  | 1                 | forsterite | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n\nscratch\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n✔\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe scratch entry identifier corresponds to the variable space id\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip\nBLOB\nA zip archive of the input files used and output files generated when equilibrating the variable space point.

The scratch row will have the same id as the associated variable space point.\nBy default, Eleanor only stores scratch entries if an error occurs while speciating the variable space point, as signified by a non-zero exit code from the kernel. In such a case a traceback.txt file is included in the zip archive detailing the error.\nThe user may specify, at runtime, that scratch be collected for all variable space speciations.\nExample:\nexample=# SELECT * FROM mineral_reactants WHERE variable_space_id = 1;\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n| id | variable_space_id | name       | log_moles | titration_rate |\n|----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------|\n| 1  | 1                 | fayalite   | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n| 2  | 1                 | forsterite | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n\n\nkernel\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n✔\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe kernel entry identifier corresponds to the variable space point\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\nVARCHAR\nThe type of the kernel used, e.g. eq36\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsettings\nJSON\nA json-encoded object of the settings passed to the kernel\n\n\n\n\nEleanor is designed to support user-provided kernels which may require specific configuration or settings. These are provided inside of the order file via the kernel block, e.g.\nkernel:\n  type: eq36\n  model: b-dot\n  charge_balance: H+\nThose settings are stored in the kernel table, one row for each variable space point. The kernel settings row will have the same id as the variable space point to which it belongs. The type of the kernel is stored alongside a JSON encodedded settings object, the form of which is kernel-specific.\nWhile, at the moment, only the eleanor.kernel.eq36 kernel is provided out-of-the-box, future versions may include other kernel implentations or the user may design and implement their own. It is then difficult to design a schema for storing the settings. Using a JSON object makes things simpler given PostgreSQL’s native JSON support.\nExample:\nexample=# SELECT * FROM mineral_reactants WHERE variable_space_id = 1;\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n| id | variable_space_id | name       | log_moles | titration_rate |\n|----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------|\n| 1  | 1                 | fayalite   | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n| 2  | 1                 | forsterite | 1.02329   | 1.0            |\n+----+-------------------+------------+-----------+----------------+\n\n\nelements\n\n\n\nPK\nFK\nN\nColumn Name\nType\nDescription\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\n\nid\nINTEGER\nThe element identifier, specific to the variable space point\n\n\n\n\n✔\n\nvariable_space_id\nINTEGER\nThe id of the variable space point for which elemental molality was generated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nVARCHAR\nThe name of the element (atomic symbol)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_molality\nDOUBLE\nThe log molality of the element in the variable space solution\n\\(\\log{molal}\\)\n\n\n\nThe elemental composition of the system’s fluid must be provided as part of the specification of a variable space point.

You might have some luck using the Linux Subsystem for Windows, but we don’t pretend to support it.\n\nEleanor requires python&gt;=3.11 an two external runtime dependencies:\n\nA slightly modified version of EQ3/6 found at 39alpha/eq3_6. Future versions will likely add other kernels based on other speciation tools, but EQ3/6 is what we have now.\nA PostgreSQL server. This is honestly the most odious dependency to install, but the PostgreSQL docs are pretty good.\n\nThere are two dev dependencies required for installation:\n\ngfortran - you should be able to install gfortran with your system’s package manager (e.g. homebrew)\nmeson - I recommend installing this via uv. See Installation below.\n\n\n\nInstallation\nI highly recommend using uv to install eleanor:\nuv tool install meson # If you haven't installed meson already\nuv tool install git+https://github.com/39alpha/eleanor\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Aqueous speciation modeling has historically focused on specific, well defined systems, and is ideal for laboratory settings or the study of a small number of real-world systems. Standard tools such as Geochemist’s Workbench and EQ3/6 exist to fill this niche, alongside more recent additions such as the WORM Portal. However, existing tools are not ideal for the study of systems that are underspecified (e.g. have incomplete composition), have high degrees of uncertainty (e.g. imprecise characterization), or for understanding the broader equilibrium landscape of systems of interest (e.g. serpentinizing systems in general). Eleanor is a powerful open-source modeling framework based on EQ3/6 which fills this gap, providing the process and data orchestration features necessary to facilitate large-scale aqueous speciation modeling. Eleanor includes a standalone executable which accepts a problem specification in YAML, TOML or JSON format, samples fully-defined systems for speciation via the EQ3/6-based “kernel”, validates the results, and stores the data in a Postgres. Eleanor’s modular design allows the user to swap the EQ3/6-based kernel with one of their own.\n\n\n\n Back to top"

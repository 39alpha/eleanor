The goal of this tool is to allow users to focus on problem specification. Notably, Eleanor is only designed to employ specific subsets of the eq36 family, and is not suitable for handling some EQ3/6 functionality.

While we hope other scientists can use this software to help answer questions about their system of interest, we also recognize that there are likely more ways to use this software incorrectly than correctly. We aim to protect against these cases but that attempt will always be incomplete.\nAll of this is to say - we hope this project helps you do science faster. But faster doesn’t mean correct."
